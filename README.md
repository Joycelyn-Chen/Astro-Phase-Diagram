# Astro-Phase-Diagram
- This is the notebook and the code where Joycelyn try to generate the energy map for the magnetohydrodynamic synthesis dataset from [Alex Hill et al 2012]()

## `energy_map/ipynb`
- This is the experimental notebook where Joycelyn play around the data and confirm which attribute to read, such as the density, temperature, velocity...etc. 
- Final code can be found in the bottom most cell

## `phase_diagram.py`
- this is the complete code for Joyceyln to plot the phase diagram for each timestamp, ultimatly made into a movie
- It depicts the Thermal pressure as a function of density for each timestamp.
